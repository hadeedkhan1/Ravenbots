This document will contain a large array of thoughts in my brain regarding the geopolitical state of the world. Some may wonder why it is important to understand the geopolitics for an area that they do not reside in, however, almost anything going on anywhere will affect you in some way, simply due to the globalization that the world has gone through in recent centuries. This is especially true if you reside is a wealthy country such as the US or any European country, as these countries rely on so many other states and nations, as well as the fact that these countries are at times, trying to assert geopolitical dominance in order to remain in control. As such, things that happen in the Middle East and other regions will directly affect you, and so one must understand how they will be affected. 

I will highlight a few regions which I personally find most interesting. These include the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Of course there are many other wars and issues that exist in other places, most notable Sudanese civil war, however, I am not as familiar with these regions, and I don't personally find them as interesting. I will look at a high level overview and then focus on each nation in particular. 

In the Middle East, it is known for being one of the most geopolitically active area. This is due to many reasons, including superimposed borders, difference in ideology, and also the insane influx of development that has hit the region in the past 60 years. I will talk about the recent war in Gaza first. 

This war against Hamas and Israel was extremely bloody for both parties, however, tensions between these regions have existed for a very long time. In recent times, the way in which Jews from Europe and other regions came to claim Israel, which existed on preoccupied land, was unfortunate for the people who were already living there. These people, mostly Muslims, were kicked out from their homes, and sent to various regions including the other gulf states, and the west bank, and Gaza. Gaza in particular in recent times has been blockaded by Israel for I believe over a decade, and as such, the conditions in Gaza were extremely terrible. There had been previous battles fought between Israelis and Palestinians before, even in the 21st century, however, by the latest conflict was ignited by Hamas attacks in Israel. Hamas being the party who led the Gaza area for a few years prior. Of course, after this Israel also retaliated, and the fighting had gotten worse. Israel had absolutely flattened Gaza to the ground by the time the ceasefire came around in early 2025. The force at which Israel had retaliated with was extreme, and many nations around the globe condemned the scale at which Israel has attacked Gaza. Of course, certain nations did not acknowledge this, such as the US to an extent, but this is to be expected since they are allies in a sense. The US had wanted stability in the Middle East for many reasons, and they aligned with Israel historically, and attempted to get other gulf states to recognize Israel, something that many of these nations had promised they would never ever do. In the end, Egypt and the UAE namely had recognized Israel, which gave a lot of power to the US in this region. Their ultimate goal was Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel, as normalizing relations with Saudi and Israel would give the US much better control over things like Saudi oil, but also, it would greatly normalize hostilities in the region. Because of this Israel and Hamas war, Saudi has become more reluctant to normalize relationships with Israel. Along with this Saudi Israel tension, Iran has also tension Saudi for a long time. One of the reasons Saudi Arabia and the US do not have the worst relationship is because they both have a common enemy named Iran. The US hates Iran for many reasons, including that Iran fundamentally hates the US with their difference in ideology, but also, Iran does not support the existence of Israel as a state. This is due to multiple reasons, but most notably the difference in ideology. Iran is a Shia Muslim state, while Israel is a Jewish state. This whether we like it or not, introduces hostility into the relationship. Iran being a Shia Muslim state is also why Saudi-Iranian relationships are very bad. Saudi follows the Sunni branch of Islam, and their government follows a very traditional variation at that. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, there is far right Shia Islam, which Iran could fall under.

The fundamental difference between these two ideologies are beyond the scope of this writing, however, be aware that these two denominations have defined splits, and many people from one of these denominations completely rejects or even hates the other denomination. Additionally, Iran is within striking distance of Saudi's major oil fields, which are the bloodline of Saudi Arabia. If Iran were to take these out, Saudi, and the rest of the world for that matter, would be in major trouble. For this reason, Saudi is extremely cautious with Iran. This has led to many proxy wars being fought between the two nations, for example in Yemen and Syria. Syria right now is in a very interesting position as Bashar al-Assad's regime has fallen. This means Russia has limited control over the Middle East, and Iran can not feed proxies through to Hezbollah in Lebanon and has limited control to attack Israel. 

Now I want to talk about Eastern Europe. Again this paper is not meant to be of the most researched highest quality thing, it is just a way of me dumping knowledge which **may or may not** be correct onto paper. So this may be a waste of your time, but that is ok. So, in Eastern Europe, we have had some wars, most notably Russia and Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine war has been fought in 2014, and now 2022. There were other battles as well, but for our purposes, these two time periods are the most important. In 2014, Russia took over Crimea. Crimea is a very strategic position due to a few things. This includes Sevastopol, and the oil in Crimea. To better illustrate this, here is a map of Crimea and the black sea.

This is the map of Sevastopol and the black sea. As you can see, Sevastopol and the tip of Crimea in general, is very close to the middle of the black sea. This allows for rapid access from Sevastopol to places like Turkey, Bulgaria, and the Aegean Sea, and the greater Atlantic. This is fundamental to security for Russia obviously, so controlling Sevastopol is very important. Sevastopol is also built very well for navy infrastructure, allowing for very any navy to very quickly setup in Sevastopol, and respond to a threat when need be. This shows how the one who controls Sevastopol, controls the Black Sea, and therefore has very nice national security. This shows how invading Crimea and trying to assert control over it was of extreme geopolitical important to Russia. Additionally, it was discovered that Crimea has a lot of oil, which Russia or Ukraine would love to control. This only makes Crimea more valuable to these two states. Additionally
