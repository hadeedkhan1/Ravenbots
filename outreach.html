            <h2>Fundraisers</h2>
            <p>Here at ICBC Ravenbots, we host bake sales to not only raise funds for our team, but to build connections and to give back to the community as they have allowed us to achieve so much as a team. All proceeds go directly towards projects and competition fees for our robotics team. These events that we host allows people to learn more about what we do, inspiring some to join or support our team. In addition to bake sales, we also acquire donations from our local community and people interested in supporting us. These efforts help continue our journey and may even inspire others to start their own. </p>

            <h2>Our FLL Teams</h2>
            <p> In addition to our fundraisers, we’re also working to support the youth in our FLL teams who may not have the chance to join FTC or other competitions yet. However, through hands-on workshops and mentorship, we introduce them to robotics and computers, allowing them to explore and grow their curiosity. Our goal is that one day, they’ll step up and continue to build on what we’ve started, shaping the future of our robotics team. </p>
